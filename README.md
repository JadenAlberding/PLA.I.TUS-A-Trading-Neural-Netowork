PLAITUS has the posibility to be a super efficient and effective 
Trading A.I. with the goal of it being able to preform just as 
well if not better than large trading corperations. The AI is a 
custom neural network created from just numpy and logic. While 
the root implimentation of the AI is based off of 
Samson Zhang [1], the ideas of how it will interact with the 
environemnet is not.

I will follow the philosiphy of you have to start somewhere. With 
limited knowledge of artificial intelligence, I figured the best 
way to learn is to fully decompose the idea of this evolving topic
and understand the roots of what I am working with.

The name PlAITUS comes from the greek gob Plutus, who is the 
greek god of wealth. The inspiration of the name not only 
,hopefully, holds true for financial gain but also knowledge.
